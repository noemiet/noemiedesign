        <p>One day, an idea came to me of expressing my thoughts through motion and audio. I was hesitant, but thought "Why not?". The next day, I shot about 30 minutes worth of footage and decided for the next five weeks that I was to create a mini series from those 30 minutes. My weekly task was to post a fifteen second video every Friday on Instagram, with each video created the week of posting. The overall plan was to strengthen my intuition and trust my vision. This is what came from it. Welcome to The Experiment.</p>
