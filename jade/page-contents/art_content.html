        <p>Tumblr has always been a spot for me to go and discover different forms of art, fashion, music, and design. I tend to search through my archives whenever I'm in the mood to be inspired. A couple of weeks ago, I went through my daily Tumblr search and a few photos stood out to me. Next thing I know, I'm making graphics based on their color palettes and turning them into graphic tees! Check it out below and read about the different photos that inspired these shirts. Also be sure to check out the artists as well! All of these are being sold through Teespring, therefore you only have until August 28th to purchase them. Scroll down to check out my inspiration and buy a tee (or two) of your own. </p>

      <h3>Inspiration for The Poet</h3>
      <p>I've been a huge fan of <a href="http://www.abstractelements.com/" target="_blank">Andre Wagner</a> for a while. I'm used to his work being predominately in black &amp; white, so it took me by surprise to see something of his in color. What makes this photo just as great is that the portrait is of <a href="http://thestriversrow.com/miles-hodges/" target="_blank">Miles Hodges</a> from Strivers Row. I actually met Miles when Strivers Row came to UGA a couple of years ago and overwhelmingly impressed with his words. Needless to say this picture is one of my absolute favs.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration for Brick</h3>
        <p>I'm OBSESSED with the tones of this particular photo shot by <a href="http://www.eightandtwo.com/post/123813304856/adonis-london" target="_blank">Yu Fujiwara</a>. The color palette is evenly distributed and it has a vintage feel to it as well.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration for Blue Street</h3>
      <p>I'm a huge fan of street style blogs and stumbled on to this one from <a href="http://www.collagevintage.com/2016/02/street-style-mfw-i-2/" target="_blank">Collage Vintage</a>. I think this photo in particular was the one that ignited the idea of doing the graphic tee project, seeing as I could totally rock the shirt with this outfit. </p>

       <h3>Inspiration for Pretty Baby</h3>
        <p>The pink and blue are really what got me into this photo for <a href="http://www.louandgrey.com/?cid=SM3791" target="_blank">Lou and Grey's</a> loobook. I'm in love with the composition and the lighting is perfect.</p>
