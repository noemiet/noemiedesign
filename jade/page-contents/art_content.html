        <p>I have a personal semi-secret tumblr where I discover and save a lot of images from my feed. Whenever Iâ€™m in a daze I search through my archives, not necessarily to find something in particular, but just to see what my mind is drawn to at the moment. A couple of images piqued my interest recently and I decided to create graphic tees based off of their color schemes. I love graphic tees, however haven't found any that I'd wear personally so I figured I make my own! All these are being sold on Teespring so there is a deadline to purchase them. If there are any that you like, feel free to buy!</p>

      <h3>Inspiration for The Poet</h3>
      <p>I've been a huge fan of <a href="http://www.abstractelements.com/" target="_blank">Andre Wagner</a> for a while. I'm used to his work being predominately in black &amp; white, so it took me by surprise to see something of his in color. What makes this photo just as great is that the portrait is of <a href="http://thestriversrow.com/miles-hodges/" target="_blank">Miles Hodges</a> from Strivers Row. I actually met Miles when Strivers Row came to UGA a couple of years ago and overwhelmingly impressed with his words. Needless to say this picture is one of my absolute favs.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration for Brick</h3>
        <p>I'm OBSESSED with the tones of this particular photo shot by <a href="http://www.eightandtwo.com/post/123813304856/adonis-london" target="_blank">Yu Fujiwara</a>. The color palette is evenly distributed and it has a vintage feel to it as well.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration for Blue Street</h3>
      <p>I'm a huge fan of street style blogs and stumbled on to this one from <a href="http://www.collagevintage.com/2016/02/street-style-mfw-i-2/" target="_blank">Collage Vintage</a>. I think this photo in particular was the one that ignited the idea of doing the graphic tee project, seeing as I could totally rock the shirt with this outfit. </p>

       <h3>Inspiration for Pretty Baby</h3>
        <p>The pink and blue are really what got me into this photo for <a href="http://www.louandgrey.com/?cid=SM3791" target="_blank">Lou and Grey's</a> loobook. I'm in love with the composition and the lighting is perfect.</p>
