      <h2>002: The Gathering Spot</h2>
      <p>Atlanta is a hub of musicians, entrepreneurs, artists, lawyers, and other young professionals alike; the source of culture that society latches onto. Will all these people and all of this influence, why not bring them together? Introducing a great product and the great people behind it.</p>

      <h2>003: Chill Out</h2>
      <p>It was 2013. A time where mobile apps weren’t as overbearing and in your face and super convinced it could solve your problems. Us four college students didn’t necessarily believe we could solve your problems, just alleviate them - through a mobile app.</p>

      <p>Millenials and entrepreneurship. When you think of CEO, you think ‘freedom’, when in actuality it’s the total opposite. In an era of social media, student loan debt, and breaking the cycle of generational societal norms - we find the truth of what it means your own boss.</p>

      <h2>005: Perkins+Will</h2>
      <p>Routine and habitual workflow removes the awareness that a process that just “works for everyone” has room to “work better for you”. What do architects do on a project and how can we make their experience better? Well first, tell them there’s an option for a better experience</p>

      <p>Richie. PJ. Joseph. None of them really fit the “political” mold. Well, except for Richie but that’s beside the point. But they loved their school and saw promise in a better student experience. Student government elections tend to carry a stigma of “ I’m better than you, vote for me”. So how do we remove that stigma? How do we convince you to vote for Reach?</p>

      <p>Here’s the deal: It was 2014. I had never been to the ever so popular NYC and I love making t-shirt designs (I’m probably wearing my own design right now). The Grady College of Journalism was looking for a design that celebrates their centennial for newly-admitted students of the major.</p>
