        <p>I, along with 3 other group members, created a mobile application that served as a solution for those who suffered from anxiety. As a group, we all either knew someone who dealt with anxiety or experienced it personally so it was important to us to ensure the user experience was one that was effective. Each of us had specific roles within the project; I was the programmer of the group. The project brought technical challenges such as working with a new form of coding, jQuery mobile, but furthermore it taught me the importance of user-focused design.</p>
